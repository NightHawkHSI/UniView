"""Template engine plugin for UniView - copy this file to start your own.

    1. Copy it to plugins/my_engine.py (files starting with "_" are ignored, so this one never loads).
    2. Change the id/name, then fill in detect(), open() and the GameSession methods you need.
    3. Restart UniView and check Help -> Engine plugins (load errors show there and in the console).

As written it's a working "loose files" engine: it shows .png/.jpg/.tga/.dds images, text files and
Wavefront .obj models found anywhere under a folder. That makes it a handy starting point for a game
that keeps some of its files unpacked. Read engines/sdk.py for the full API and engines/source.py or
engines/unreal.py for real examples (archives, binary formats, materials).

Only the standard library, numpy and Pillow (PIL) are guaranteed to be available, also in the
packaged UniView.exe. Anything else you import has to be installed next to it yourself.

The type hints are optional, but with them an editor (or `py -m mypy plugins/my_engine.py`) tells
you when a method returns the wrong shape - see the TypedDicts at the top of engines/sdk.py.
